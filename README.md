At the beginning of the Game you will be met with a Question. In order to answer the Question, click one of the choice boxes allocated at the bottom of the screen.

Depending on which option you choose, it will affect the *Reputation* and *Virus* values differently. For every correct answer, the *Reputation* value increases and the *Virus* value decreases. For every incorrect answer, the *Virus* value increases and the *Reputation* value decreases. A box will then appear telling the player the correct way of handling the given question.

A player wins the game if they reach a *Reputation* value of 100 and *Virus* value of 0. A playerâ€™s score is based on the number of turns it takes for them to reach this, and if eligible, will be saved to the Highscores table for everyone to see.

If the player *Reputation* value reaches 0 or their *Virus* value reaches 100, then the game ends in defeat.
